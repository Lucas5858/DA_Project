    "The Bayesian Models developed in this project are designed to predict the probability of patient mortality due to adverse reactions from COVID-19 vaccination. The predictions are based on various predictors, such as the patient's age, sex, number of days since vaccination, and the number of days the patient had to spend in the hospital due to the adverse reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of creating these models is to present the probability of patient mortality in an unbiased and objective manner. The first model is more general, utilizing two predictors, while the second model employs four predictors. Both models can be used similarly to illustrate the influence of different predictors on the final outcome. Healthcare is a critical aspect of our lives, and conducting unbiased research is essential to improving the quality of all forms of medicine and medical services.\n",

    "Established in 1990, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems in U.S.-licensed vaccines. VAERS is co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). VAERS accepts and analyzes reports of adverse events (possible side effects) after a person has received a vaccination. Anyone can report an adverse event to VAERS. Healthcare professionals are required to report certain adverse events and vaccine manufacturers are required to report all adverse events that come to their attention.\n",
